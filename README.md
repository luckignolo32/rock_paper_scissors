# Rock, paper, scissors
Just a simple PvE rock, paper, scissors game coded in Javascript. Special thanks to my brother for testing it. Not a single line was written with AI, so you can just blame me if it sucks.
## How to play
The game was made to be played in your browser. There's no particular procedure to follow (it'just a matter of opening the `index.html` file from your browser), but in case you're not familiar with running local stuff on your browser, follow these steps:
- clone this repo anywhere on your computer
