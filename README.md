# Rock, paper, scissors
Just a simple PvE rock, paper, scissors game coded in Javascript for exercise. Special thanks to my brother for testing it. Not a single line was written with AI, so you can just blame me if it sucks.
## How to play
The game was made to be played in your browser. There's no particular procedure to follow (it's just a matter of opening the `index.html` file from your browser), but in case you're not familiar with running local stuff on your browser, follow these steps:
- **clone** this repo anywhere on your computer: `git clone https://github.com/luckignolo32/rock_paper_scissors.git`
- **navigate** to the repo: `cd rock_paper_scissors`
- **execute** `pwd` to show your current directory; copy it (you might have to use Ctrl+Shift+C, depending on your distribution)
- **open** a new browser tab and **paste** the copied directory + `index.html` preceded by `file://`. If a popup is shown, everything is working correctly

>If you had to restart during your game, do it in another tab, otherwhise it's probably gonna loop indefinitely.
